# Roller
An interactive dice rolling command parser written with Rust. WIP

The aim is to create a simple (yeah, right) interactive command-line parser for virtual dice throwing, using the [dice notation] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dice_notation).

In addition, there will be other features, such as filtering expressions, variables and functions.

## Language reference

The folder lang-ref contains reference for the Roller script written in Markdown.

The old reference files are kept in the old-lang-ref folder for future reference.
