# Roller
An interactive dice rolling command parser. WIP

The aim is to create a simple interactive command-line parser for virtual dice throwing, using the dice notation ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dice_notation ). 
In addition there will be other features, such as variable and function definition.

The "roller_rules.cf" -file contains the parsing rules in Labeled BNF grammar as used by the BNFC program ( http://bnfc.digitalgrammars.com )
