# Roller
An interactive dice rolling command parser written with Rust. WIP

The aim of the project is to create a simple interactive REPL command-line application for virtual dice throwing, using the [dice notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dice_notation), and to teach myself Rust and programming language design.

In addition, there will be other features such as strings, variables, functions and collection types.

## Language reference

The program parses and evaluates a dynamically typed script language called Roller script.

References (still incomplete) for the language are found in the folder lang-ref.

The old reference files are kept in the old-lang-ref folder for future reference.
