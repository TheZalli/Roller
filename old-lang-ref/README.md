# Old reference

This folder contains some old reference files to be kept for reference for future design.

The Roller.cf -file contains the parsing rules in Labeled BNF grammar, as used by the [BNFC program] (http://bnfc.digitalgrammars.com).
Though at the moment I will not use BNFC anymore, and it is outdated, the file is still left as a reference for the current implementation.

The "language draft" files contain, drafts and ideas for the finished Roller language.
It is currently superseded by the lang-ref files.
